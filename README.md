🪐 Age_Convertor – See Your Age on Every Planet
**🌌 Introduction**

Age_Convertor is a fun and interactive web tool that lets users explore how old they would be on other planets in our solar system. Since every planet takes a different amount of time to orbit the Sun, your "age" would vary depending on where you are. This project brings that concept to life in a visually simple and educational way.

**💡 What It Does**
Just enter your Earth age, and the app instantly calculates your age on:

🟤 Mercury

🟡 Venus

🔴 Mars

🟠 Jupiter

🟣 Saturn

🔵 Uranus

🌀 Neptune

It uses actual orbital ratios to give accurate conversions and presents the results in a clean, emoji-enhanced interface.

**⚙️ Built With**

✅ HTML – Form input and structure

✅ CSS – Styling and layout

✅ JavaScript – Logic for conversion and real-time result updates

✅ No frameworks, no APIs – 100% frontend, works instantly in any browser

**🎓 Why It’s Useful**

Whether you're a student learning about planets or just a curious space fan, Age_Convertor offers a fun way to understand planetary time. It’s perfect for education, portfolio projects, or space-themed hackathons — and it's fast, free, and completely offline-capable.
